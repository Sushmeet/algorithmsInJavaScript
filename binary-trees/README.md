# Binary Trees

> A binary tree is chosen over other primary data structures because
 1. You can search a binary tree very quickly compared to linked list
 2. You can also quickly insert and delete data from a binary tree as 
 opposed to an array.
 3. eg A company's org chart is a tree.
 4 Root node is a level 0
 5 Children are at level 1
